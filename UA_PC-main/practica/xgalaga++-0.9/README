                                  XGALAGA++

XGalaga++ is a classic vertical scrolling shoot'em up. It requires no X Window
extension and its window is freely resizable. It is inspired by XGalaga,
but rewritten from scratch, except for the graphics.

BUGS

Know bugs
- Sprite are erased before being drawn at a new position and erasure also
  affects the background. Could be corrected with dual-buffering, but it
  takes much more CPU time.
- The scrolling is not _really_ smooth (I miss the Amiga :-)) However, it is
  not worse than other X11 games.

Please send bug reports and suggestions to marc@mongenet.ch.

I created this game because I was annoyed by bugs in XGalaga 2.0.34 and the
source files were too difficult to modify. So I learned X11 (XLib) programming
from Web tutorials and wrote this game.
Of course, xgalaga++ is probably as buggy as the original XGalaga.
